# Pseudo code practice

1. a method that returns the sum of two integers

SET variable to the sum of integer1 and integer2
return the variable


2. a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together

set variable to empty string
while array still has elements
    add to variable the current string
    go to next element in array
return variable


3. a method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element

set new array to empty array
while array still has elements
    if index of element is odd
        add element to new array
    go to next element
return new array
